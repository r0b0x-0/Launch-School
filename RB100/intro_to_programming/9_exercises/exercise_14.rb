# Q14. Take the following array:

a = ['white snow', 'winter wonderland', 'melting ice', 'slippery sidewalk', 'salted roads', 'white trees']

# Q14. and turn it into a new array that consists of strings containing one word. (ex. ["white snow", etc...] â†’ ["white", "snow", etc...]. Look into using Array's map and flatten methods, as well as String's split method.

p new_arr = a.each.map { |phrase| phrase.split(" ")}.flatten
